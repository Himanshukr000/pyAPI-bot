[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

Python bot to help your Lazy inner Self. This bot Automates your Twitter Work (Liking, Latest Tweets, Follow & unfollow) and Play some Music while You're Bored.

### Requirements :
* Python 3 
* Tweepy
* speech_recognition
* gTTS
* An Internet Connection (that's important!)

### Setup :
1. Just do ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ``` and all the requiements will be installed on your system
2. For Tweepy you would need four tokens (Yea that's right 4 :grin: ). For that:
    * Goto https://apps.twitter.com/ and Create an App to generate your **4** Tokens 
      ```
        consumer_key = 'consumer key'
        consumer_secret = 'consumer secrets'
        access_token = 'access token'
        access_token_secret = 'access token secret'
      ```
    * While Creating the App twitter wwill ask about some things (short and long ones). So fill those out and you would               successfully create the App.
    
 ### Usage :
 1. For Twitter :
    * Saying ``` Show the tweets ``` will command the bot to read the tweets for you (Latest ones).
    * Saying ``` Like [username] ``` will like the username's tweet in the recent tweets.
    * Saying ``` Follow [username] ``` will follow the username. 
    * Saying ``` Unfollow [username] ``` will unfollow the username from your Followers List.
 
 2. For Music :
    * Saying ``` Play [Songname] ``` will play the Song for you. Cool isn't it. :smile:
    
 That's all for our bot.
